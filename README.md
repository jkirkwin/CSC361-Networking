Coursework for CSC361, Computer Networks

## Assignment 1
A dead simple HTTP client and server running over TCP.

## Assignment 2
A dead simple Ping client and server running over UDP.

## Assignment 3
A stop-and-wait HTTP-like protocol running over UDP. 

This required some thought for the design (unlike the previous two assignments) and let me apply some of the flow and error control strategies I learned in class from studying TCP.
